 üë®‚Äçüíª Admin by profession, explorer by mindset.

I'm a systems and network administrator with a strong background in Linux environments, infrastructure management, and IT security. My journey began with hands-on experience during internships and academic projects, where I tackled everything from pfSense firewalls to high-availability Windows clusters.

Today, I'm fully committed to mastering cybersecurity ‚Äî from SOC analysis to privilege escalation ‚Äî and building secure, automated systems using tools like Ansible, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines with GitLab & GitHub.

Like nature, systems thrive when balanced. I secure infrastructures the way I observe ecosystems: with precision, respect, and a deep sense of responsibility.

üå± Always learning. Always evolving. On a path from Linux admin to cybersecurity expert üõ°Ô∏è.
